### Installation

#### Snap
[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/snakeit)
<br>
Check out the link above for installation instructions. Once installed, type `snakeit` to start the game!

#### Other
If you don't have access to the Snap Store you can of course just install it manually. To do so, navigate to some directory where you store git clones and type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsakTheHacker/snakeit.git
cd snakeit
mkdir bin
make

```
To start `snakeit`, type:
```bash
./bin/snakeit
```

For a more permanent solution, append `alias snakeit="<pathToBinary>"` to `~/.bashrc`. Then restart your terminal and just type `snakeit` to start the game!
